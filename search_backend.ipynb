            "[Row(id=7089, text='thumb|Paul Gavarni \\'\\'Woman Chocolate Vendor\\'\\' (1855–1857)\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Chocolate\\'\\'\\' is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE), and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.\\n\\nThe seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.\\n\\nChocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine\\'s Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.\\n\\nAlthough cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly Côte d\\'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.\\n\\nWith some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in 2018, and continue to be. International attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nMesoamerican usage\\n\\nthumb|left|Two Mayans sit around a container of frothed chocolate.\\nChocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate\\'s preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC. On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC. The residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cocoa was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cocoa beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.\\n\\nthumb|upright|Aztec. \\'\\'Man Carrying a Cacao Pod\\'\\', 1440–1521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Brooklyn Museum\\nAn early Classic-period (460–480 AD) Mayan tomb from the site in Rio Azul had vessels with the Maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink, suggests the Maya were drinking chocolate around 400\\xa0AD. Documents in Maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes, in addition to everyday life. The Maya grew cacao trees in their backyards, and used the cocoa seeds the trees produced to make a frothy, bitter drink.\\n\\nBy the 15th century, the Aztecs gained control of a large part of Mesoamerica and adopted cocoa into their culture. They associated chocolate with Quetzalcoatl, who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans, and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice. In contrast to the Maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the Aztecs drank it cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the \\'\\'Cymbopetalum penduliflorum\\'\\' tree, chile pepper, allspice, vanilla, and honey.\\n\\nThe Aztecs were unable to grow cocoa themselves, as their home in the Mexican highlands was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire. Those who lived in areas ruled by the Aztecs were required to offer cocoa seeds in payment of the tax they deemed \"tribute\". Cocoa beans were often used as currency. For example, the Aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost 100 cocoa beans and one fresh avocado was worth three beans.\\n\\nThe Maya and Aztecs associated cocoa with human sacrifice, and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human blood.\\nThe Spanish royal chronicler Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés described a chocolate drink he had seen in Nicaragua in 1528, mixed with achiote: \"because those people are fond of drinking human blood, to make this beverage seem like blood, they add a little achiote, so that it then turns red. ... and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth, and when it is red for having achiote, it seems a horrific thing, because it seems like blood itself.\"\\n\\nEuropean adaptation\\n\\nright|thumb|upright|Chocolate soon became a fashionable drink of the European nobility after the discovery of the Americas. \\'\\'The morning chocolate\\'\\' by Pietro Longhi; Venice, 1775–1780\\n\\nUntil the 16th century, no European had ever heard of the popular drink from the Central American peoples. Christopher Columbus and his son Ferdinand encountered the cocoa bean on Columbus\\'s fourth mission to the Americas on 15 August 1502, when he and his crew seized a large native canoe that proved to contain cocoa beans among other goods for trade. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés may have been the first European to encounter it, as the frothy drink was part of the after-dinner routine of Montezuma. José de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, wrote of its growing influence on the Spaniards:\\nAlthough bananas are more profitable, cocoa is more highly esteemed in Mexico. . . Cocoa is a smaller fruit than almonds and thicker, which toasted do not taste bad. It is so prized among the Indians and even among Spaniards. . . because since it is a dried fruit it can be stored for a long time without deterioration, and they brings ships loaded with them from the province of Guatemala. . . It also serves as currency, because with five cocoas you can buy one thing, with thirty another, and with a hundred something else, without there being contradiction; and they give these cocoas as alms to the poor who beg for them. The principal product of this cocoa is a concoction which they make that they call “chocolate,” which is a crazy thing treasured in that land, and those who are not accustomed are disgusted by it, because it has a foam on top and a bubbling like that of feces, which certainly takes a lot to put up with. Anyway, it is the prized beverage which the Indians offer to nobles who come to or pass through their lands; and the Spaniards, especially Spanish women born in those lands die for black chocolate. This aforementioned chocolate is said to the be made in various forms and temperaments, hot, cold, and lukewarm. They are wont to use spices and much chili; they also make it into a paste, and it is said that it is a medicine to treat coughs, the stomach, and colds. Whatever may be the case, in fact those who have not been reared on this opinion are not appetized by it.\\n\\nthumb|left|upright|\\'\\'\"Traités nouveaux & curieux du café du thé et du chocolate\"\\'\\', by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\\nWhile Columbus had taken cocoa beans with him back to Spain, chocolate made no impact until Spanish friars introduced it to the Spanish court. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe. There, it quickly became a court favorite. It was still served as a beverage, but the Spanish added sugar, as well as honey (the original sweetener used by the Aztecs for chocolate), to counteract the natural bitterness. Vanilla, another indigenous American introduction, was also a popular additive, with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor. Unfortunately, these spices tended to unsettle the European constitution; the \\'\\'Encyclopédie\\'\\' states, \"The pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended; but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset one\\'s stomach\", which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as \"healthy chocolate\". By 1602, chocolate had made its way from Spain to Austria. By 1662, Pope Alexander VII had declared that religious fasts were not broken by consuming chocolate drinks. Within about a hundred years, chocolate established a foothold throughout Europe.\\nthumb|right|upright=.6|Silver chocolate pot with hinged finial to insert a \\'\\'moulinet\\'\\' or swizzle stick, London 1714–15 (Victoria and Albert Museum)\\n\\nthumb|left|upright|Dutch chemist Coenraad Johannes van Houten invented \"Dutch cocoa\" by treating cocoa mass with alkaline salts to reduce the natural bitterness without adding sugar or milk to get usable cocoa powder.\\n\\nThe new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market, as between the early 1600s and late 1800s, the laborious and slow processing of the cocoa bean was manual. Cocoa plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cocoa production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.\\n\\nNew processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness. A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter or cocoa butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate.\\nthumb|Fry\\'s produced the first chocolate in solid state in 1847, which was then mass-produced as Fry\\'s Chocolate Cream in 1866.\\n\\nKnown as \"Dutch cocoa\", this machine-pressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, English chocolatier Joseph Fry discovered a way to make chocolate moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter. Subsequently, his chocolate factory, Fry\\'s of Bristol, England, began mass-producing chocolate bars, Fry\\'s Chocolate Cream, launched in 1866, and they became very popular. Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestlé with the liquor. In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.\\n\\nBesides Nestlé, several notable chocolate companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rowntree\\'s of York set up and began producing chocolate in 1862, after buying out the Tuke family business. Cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868. Manufacturing their first Easter egg in 1875, Cadbury created the modern chocolate Easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be molded into smooth shapes. In 1893, Milton S. Hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the World\\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and soon began the career of Hershey\\'s chocolates with chocolate-coated caramels.\\n\\nIntroduction to the United States\\nThe Baker Chocolate Company, which makes Baker\\'s Chocolate, is the oldest producer of chocolate in the United States. In 1765 Dr. James Baker and John Hannon founded the company  in Boston. Using cocoa beans from the West Indies, the pair built their chocolate business, which is still in operation.\\n\\nWhite chocolate was first introduced to the U.S. in 1946 by Frederick E. Hebert of Hebert Candies in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, near Boston, after he had tasted \"white coat\" candies while traveling in Europe.\\n\\nEtymology\\nthumb|Maya glyph for cocoa\\n\\nCocoa, pronounced by the Olmecs as \\'\\'kakawa\\'\\', dates to 1000\\xa0BC or earlier. The word \"chocolate\" entered the English language from Spanish in about 1600. The word entered Spanish from the word \\'\\'chocolātl\\'\\' in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The origin of the Nahuatl word is uncertain, as it does not appear in any early Nahuatl source, where the word for chocolate drink is \\'\\'cacahuatl\\'\\', \"cocoa water\". It is possible that the Spaniards coined the word (perhaps in order to avoid \\'\\'caca\\'\\', a vulgar Spanish word for \"faeces\") by combining the Yucatec Mayan word \\'\\'chocol\\'\\', \"hot\", with the Nahuatl word \\'\\'atl\\'\\', \"water\". A widely-cited proposal is that the derives from unattested \\'\\'xocolatl\\'\\' meaning \"bitter drink\" is unsupported; the change from \\'\\'x-\\'\\' to \\'\\'ch-\\'\\' is unexplained, as is the \\'\\'-l-\\'\\'. Another proposed etymology derives it from the word \\'\\'chicolatl\\'\\', meaning \"beaten drink\", which may derive from the word for the frothing stick, \\'\\'chicoli\\'\\'. Other scholars reject all these proposals, considering the origin of first element of the name to be unknown.   The term \"chocolatier\", for a chocolate confection maker, is attested from 1888.\\n\\nTypes\\n\\nthumb|Chocolate is commonly used as a coating for various fruits such as cherries and/or fillings, such as liqueurs\\n\\nSeveral types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate, often called \"baking chocolate\", contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with sugar.\\n\\nMilk\\nMilk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the rest of the European Union, the minimum is 25%.\\n\\nWhite\\n\\nthumb|White chocolate\\nWhite chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids that impart a dark color. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration established a standard for white chocolate as the \"common or usual name of products made from cocoa fat (i.e., cocoa butter), milk solids, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and other safe and suitable ingredients, but containing no nonfat cocoa solids\".\\n\\nDark\\nDark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cocoa mixture. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration calls this \"sweet chocolate\", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids. A higher amount of cocoa solids indicates more bitterness. Semisweet chocolate is dark chocolate with low sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter and vanilla are added. It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking. It is also known to last for two years if stored properly. , there is no high-quality evidence that dark chocolate affects blood pressure significantly or provides other health benefits.\\n\\nUnsweetened\\nUnsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cocoa, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cocoa.\\nthumb|Unsweetened \"Baking\" Chocolate\\nPoorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part, called chocolate bloom; it is an indication that sugar or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is not toxic and can be safely consumed.\\n\\nProduction\\n\\nthumb|upright|Chocolate is created from the cocoa bean. A cacao tree with fruit pods in various stages of ripening.\\nRoughly two-thirds of the entire world\\'s cocoa is produced in West Africa, with 43% sourced from Côte d\\'Ivoire, where, , child labor is a common practice to obtain the product. According to the World Cocoa Foundation, in 2007 some 50\\xa0million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood.  in the UK, most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them, to melt, mold and package to their own design. According to the WCF\\'s 2012 report, the Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world. The two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers. Chocolate makers use harvested cocoa beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate (covering). Chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies (bars, truffles, etc.).\\n\\nProduction costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called \"chocolate\", due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.\\n\\nGenome\\nThe sequencing in 2010 of the genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved. Due to concerns about global warming effects on lowland climate in the narrow band of latitudes where cocoa is grown (20 degrees north and south of the equator), the commercial company Mars, Incorporated and the University of California, Berkeley are conducting genomic research in 2017–18 to improve the survivability of cacao plants in hot climates.\\n\\nCacao varieties\\nthumb|left|Toasted cocoa beans at a chocolate workshop at the La Chonita Hacienda in Tabasco.\\nChocolate is made from cocoa beans, the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree (\\'\\'Theobroma cacao\\'\\'), a small, 4–8 m tall (15–26\\xa0ft tall) evergreen tree native to the deep tropical region of the Americas. Recent genetic studies suggest the most common genotype of the plant originated in the Amazon basin and was gradually transported by humans throughout South and Central America. Early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now Venezuela. The scientific name, \\'\\'Theobroma\\'\\', means \"food of the gods\". The fruit, called a cocoa pod, is ovoid,  long and  wide, ripening yellow to orange, and weighing about  when ripe.\\n\\nCacao trees are small, understory trees that need rich, well-drained soils. They naturally grow within 20° of either side of the equator because they need about 2000\\xa0mm of rainfall a year, and temperatures in the range of . Cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than .\\n\\nThe three main varieties of cocoa beans used in chocolate are criollo, forastero, and trinitario.\\n\\nCriollo\\nRepresenting only 5% of all cocoa beans grown , criollo is the rarest and most expensive cocoa on the market, and is native to Central America, the Caribbean islands and the northern tier of South American states. The genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo is disputed, as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties.\\n\\nCriollos are particularly difficult to grow, as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree. The flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex, low in classic chocolate flavor, but rich in \"secondary\" notes of long duration.\\n\\nForastero\\nThe most commonly grown bean is forastero, a large group of wild and cultivated cocoas, most likely native to the Amazon basin. The African cocoa crop is entirely made up of forastero. They are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo. The source of most chocolate marketed, forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic \"chocolate\" flavor, but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors, producing \"quite bland\" chocolate.\\n\\nTrinitario\\nTrinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero. Trinitario originated in Trinidad after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop. Nearly all cocoa produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lower-grade trinitario varieties.\\n\\nProcessing \\nthumb|upright|\"Dancing the cocoa\", El Cidros, Trinidad, c. 1957\\nCocoa pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete, or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to micro-organisms so fermentation of the pectin-containing material can begin. Yeasts produce ethanol, lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate taste.\\n\\nIt is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.\\n\\nThe dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), roasted, and graded. Next, the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: chocolate liquor. The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.\\n\\nBlending\\n\\nChocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couverture. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are:\\nthumb|upright|Fountain chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter, allowing it to flow gently over a chocolate fountain to serve as dessert fondue.\\n Dark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla\\n Milk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\\n White chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\\n\\nUsually, an emulsifying agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel.\\n\\nThe texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus has a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.\\n\\nDifferent manufacturers develop their own \"signature\" blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couverture contains at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couverture contains only about 35% cocoa butter.\\n\\nProducers of high-quality, small-batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad-quality chocolate. Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.\\n\\nIn 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestlé, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes. Currently, the FDA does not allow a product to be referred to as \"chocolate\" if the product contains any of these ingredients.\\n\\nIn the EU a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to 5% vegetable oil, and must be labeled as \"family milk chocolate\" rather than \"milk chocolate\" if it contains 20% milk.\\n\\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations, a \"chocolate product\" is a food product that is sourced from at least one \"cocoa product\" and contains at least one of the following: \"chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate\". A \"cocoa product\" is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains \"cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor, cocoa mass, unsweetened chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, cocoa, low-fat cocoa, cocoa powder, or low-fat cocoa powder\".\\n\\nConching\\n\\nthumb|Chocolate melanger mixing raw ingredients\\nThe penultimate process is called conching. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate before conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect (typically around 20 μm) and reduces rough edges, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72\\xa0hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about  until final processing.\\n\\nTempering\\nthumb|Video of cocoa beans being ground and mixed with other ingredients to make chocolate at a Mayordomo store in Oaxaca\\nThe final process is called tempering. Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken. The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.\\n\\nThe fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms (polymorphous crystallization). The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.\\n\\n Crystal Melting temp. NotesISoft, crumbly, melts too easilyIISoft, crumbly, melts too easilyIIIFirm, poor snap, melts too easilyIVFirm, good snap, melts too easilyVGlossy, firm, best snap, melts near body temperature (37\\xa0°C)VIHard, takes weeks to form\\n\\nthumb|Molten chocolate and a piece of a chocolate bar\\n\\nAs a solid piece of chocolate, the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases – the melting process. When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.\\n\\nThe temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat. Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.\\n\\nMaking chocolate considered \"good\" is about forming as many type V crystals as possible. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.\\n\\nthumb|Chocolate cubes, \\'\\'pistoles\\'\\' and \\'\\'callets\\'\\'\\n\\nGenerally, the chocolate is first heated to  to melt all six forms of crystals. Next, the chocolate is cooled to about , which will allow crystal types IV and V to form. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal \"seeds\" which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate. The chocolate is then heated to about  to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated. Other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid \"seed\" chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.\\n\\nTwo classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:\\n Working the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal \"seeds\"; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.\\n Stirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to \"inoculate\" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to \"seed\" the molten chocolate).\\n\\nChocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate. In particular, continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and Buhler, three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40–50\\xa0°C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26–30\\xa0°C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.\\n\\nShaping\\nChocolate is molded in different shapes for different uses:\\n Chocolate bars (tablets) are rectangular blocks of chocolate meant to be broken down to cubes (or other predefined shapes), which can then be used for consumption, cooking and baking. The term is also used for combination bars, which are a type of candy bars\\n Chocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate, usually drop-like, which are meant for decoration and baking\\n \\'\\'Pistoles\\'\\', \\'\\'callets\\'\\' and \\'\\'fèves\\'\\' are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and Fève (trinket))\\n Chocolate blocks are large, cuboid chunks of chocolate meant for professional use and further processing\\n Other, more specialized shapes for chocolate include sticks, curls and hollow semi-spheres\\n\\nStorage\\nthumb|Packaged chocolate in the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company is stored in controlled conditions.\\nChocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between , with a relative humidity of less than 50%. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Various types of \"blooming\" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly.\\n\\nChocolate bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding , while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below  or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. Moving chocolate between temperature extremes, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected. Bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.\\n\\nChocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper. The glossy shine, snap, aroma, texture, and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well.\\n\\nComposition\\n\\nNutrition\\nA 100-gram serving of milk chocolate supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated, mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table).\\n\\n100-grams of milk chocolate is an \\'\\'excellent source\\'\\' (over 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin, vitamin B12 and the dietary minerals, manganese, phosphorus and zinc. Chocolate is a \\'\\'good source\\'\\' (10–19% DV) of calcium, magnesium and iron.\\n\\nEffects on health\\n\\nChocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because one of its constituents, theobromine, may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus. Theobromine poisoning is an overdosage reaction to the bitter alkaloid, which happens more frequently in domestic animals than humans. However, daily intake of 50–100 g cocoa (0.8–1.5 g theobromine) by humans has been associated with sweating, trembling and severe headache. Chocolate contains alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine, which have physiological effects in humans, but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals, including dogs and cats.\\n\\nAccording to a 2005 study, the average lead concentration of cocoa beans is ≤ 0.5 ng/g, which is one of the lowest reported values for a natural food. However, during cultivation and production, chocolate may absorb lead from the environment (such as in atmospheric emissions of leaded gasoline, which is still being used in Nigeria). Reports from 2014 indicate that \"chocolate might be a significant source\" of lead ingestion for children if consumption is high (with dark chocolate containing higher amounts), and \"one 10\\xa0g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20% of the daily lead oral limit.\"\\n\\nChocolate and cocoa contain moderate to high amounts of oxalate, which may increase the risk of kidney stones. \\n\\nA few studies have documented allergic reactions from chocolate in children. Other research has shown that dark chocolate can aggravate acne in men who are prone to it. Research has also shown that consuming dark chocolate does not substantially affect blood pressure. Chocolate and cocoa are under preliminary research to determine if consumption affects the risk of certain cardiovascular diseases or cognitive abilities.\\n\\nOne tablespoonful (5 grams) of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has 12.1\\xa0mg of caffeine and a 25-g single serving of dark chocolate has 22.4\\xa0mg of caffeine. Although a single 7\\xa0oz. serving of coffee may contain 80–175\\xa0mg, studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as 9\\xa0mg, and a dose as low as 12.5\\xa0mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performance.\\n\\nExcessive consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories, can cause weight gain and possibly lead to obesity. Raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter, a fat which is removed during chocolate refining and then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers may add other fats, sugars, and milk, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate.\\n\\nPhytochemicals\\n\\nIn comparison to most foods, cocoa contains more phenolic antioxidants. Cocoa solids are a source of flavonoids and alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine, and caffeine.\\n\\nLabeling\\nSome manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of \"cocoa\" or \"cacao\". This refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar, not just the percentage of cocoa solids. The Belgian AMBAO certification mark indicates that no non-cocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate. A long-standing dispute between Britain on the one hand and Belgium and France over British use of vegetable fats in chocolate ended in 2000 with the adoption of new standards which permitted the use of up to five percent vegetable fats in clearly labelled products. This British style of chocolate has sometimes been pejoratively referred to as \"vegelate\".\\n\\nChocolates that are organic or fair trade certified carry labels accordingly.\\n\\nIn the United States, some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as \"chocolate\". In June 2007, in response to consumer concern about the proposal, the FDA reiterated \"Cacao fat, as one of the signature characteristics of the product, will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate.\"\\n\\nIndustry\\nChocolate, prevalent throughout the world, is a steadily growing, US$50\\xa0billion-a-year worldwide business. Europe accounts for 45% of the world\\'s chocolate revenue, and the US spent $20\\xa0billion in 2013. Big Chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in Europe and the U.S. U.S. companies Mars and Hershey\\'s alone generated $13\\xa0billion a year in chocolate sales and account for two-thirds of U.S. production in 2004. Despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally, cocoa farmers and labourers in the Ivory Coast are unaware of the uses of the beans; the high cost of chocolate products in the Ivory Coast make it inaccessible to the majority of the population, who do not know what it tastes like.\\n\\nManufacturers\\n\\nthumb|Chocolate with various fillings\\nChocolate manufacturers produce a range of products from chocolate bars to fudge. Large manufacturers of chocolate products include Cadbury (the world\\'s largest confectionery manufacturer), Ferrero, Guylian, The Hershey Company, Lindt & Sprüngli, Mars, Incorporated, Milka, Neuhaus and Suchard.\\n\\nGuylian is best known for its chocolate sea shells; Cadbury for its Dairy Milk and Creme Egg. The Hershey Company, the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America, produces the Hershey Bar and Hershey\\'s Kisses. Mars Incorporated, a large privately owned U.S. corporation, produces Mars Bar, Milky Way, M&M\\'s, Twix, and Snickers. Lindt is known for its truffle balls and gold foil-wrapped Easter bunnies.\\n\\nFood conglomerates Nestlé SA and Kraft Foods both have chocolate brands. Nestlé acquired Rowntree\\'s in 1988 and now markets chocolates under their brand, including Smarties (a chocolate candy) and Kit Kat (a chocolate bar); Kraft Foods through its 1990 acquisition of Jacobs Suchard, now owns Milka and Suchard. In February 2010, Kraft also acquired British-based Cadbury; Fry\\'s, Trebor Basset and the fair trade brand Green & Black\\'s also belongs to the group.\\n\\nChild labor in cocoa harvesting\\n\\nThe widespread use of children in cocoa production is controversial, not only for the concerns about child labor and exploitation, but also because up to 12,000 of the 200,000 children working in Côte d\\'Ivoire, the world\\'s biggest producer of cocoa, may be victims of trafficking or slavery. Most attention on this subject has focused on West Africa, which collectively supplies 69 percent of the world\\'s cocoa, and Côte d\\'Ivoire in particular, which supplies 35 percent of the world\\'s cocoa. Thirty percent of children under age 15 in sub-Saharan Africa are child laborers, mostly in agricultural activities including cocoa farming. Major chocolate producers, such as Nestlé, buy cocoa at commodities exchanges where Ivorian cocoa is mixed with other cocoa.\\n\\nIn 2009, Salvation Army International Development (SAID) UK stated that 12,000 children have been trafficked on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast of Africa, where half of the world\\'s chocolate is made. SAID UK states that it is these child slaves who are likely to be working in \"harsh and abusive\" conditions for the production of chocolate, and an increasing number of health-food and anti-slavery organisations are highlighting and campaigning against the use of trafficking in the chocolate industry.\\n\\nAs of 2017, approximately 2.1\\xa0million children in Ghana and Côte d\\'Ivoire were involved in farming cocoa, carrying heavy loads, clearing forests, and being exposed to pesticides. According to Sona Ebai, the former secretary-general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries: \"I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it\\'s the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector. And there, you need leadership.\" Reported in 2018, a 3-year pilot program – conducted by Nestlé with 26,000 farmers mostly located in Côte d\\'Ivoire – observed a 51% decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming. The US Department of Labor formed the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group as a public-private partnership with the governments of Ghana and Côte d\\'Ivoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry. The International Cocoa Initiative involving major cocoa manufacturers established the Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System intended to monitor thousands of farms in Ghana and Côte d\\'Ivoire for child labor conditions, but the program reached less than 20% of the child laborers. Despite these efforts, goals to reduce child labor in West Africa by 70% before 2020 are frustrated by persistent poverty, absence of schools, expansion of cocoa farmland, and increased demand for cocoa.\\n\\nIn April 2018, the Cocoa Barometer report stated: \"Not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sector-wide objective of the elimination of child labor, and not even near their commitments of a 70% reduction of child labor by 2020\".\\n\\nFair trade\\n\\nIn the 2000s, some chocolate producers began to engage in fair trade initiatives, to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries. Traditionally, Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fairtrade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system. One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an Agricultural cooperative. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees. One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. The effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned. In a 2014 article, \\'\\'The Economist\\'\\' stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system.\\n\\nUsage and consumption\\nthumb|A s\\'more topped with melted chocolate from a chocolate bar\\nthumb|left|Chocolate cake with chocolate frosting\\n\\nBars\\n\\nChocolate is sold in chocolate bars, which come in dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins, or crisped rice. Chocolate is used as an ingredient in a huge variety of bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., nougat, wafers, caramel, nuts, etc.) which are coated in chocolate.\\n\\nCoating and filling\\nChocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies. Numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., M&M\\'s) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts).\\n\\nBeverages\\nSome non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate, chocolate milkshakes and tejate. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao. Chocolate is a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding, and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes. The caffè mocha is an espresso beverage containing chocolate.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n \\'\\'Candida krusei\\'\\'\\n Candy making\\n Children in cocoa production\\n Chocolataire\\n Chocolate almonds\\n Chocolate chip\\n Chocoholic\\n \\'\\'Cuestión moral: si el chocolate quebranta el ayuno eclesiástico\\'\\'\\n List of chocolate-covered foods\\n List of chocolate beverages\\n List of chocolate companies\\n \\'\\'Theobroma cacao\\'\\', the cocoa/chocolate plant\\n United States military chocolate\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFurther reading\\n \\n \\n  Norton, Marcy. \\'\\'Sacred Gifts, Profane Pleasures: A History of Tobacco and Chocolate in the Atlantic World\\'\\' (Cornell UP, 2008)\\n \\n Rosenblum, Mort (2006). \\'\\'Chocolate: A Bittersweet Saga of Dark and Light\\'\\'.

Typically, episodes affect one side of the head, are pulsating in nature, and last from a few hours to three days. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse by physical activity, although regular exercise may have prophylactic effects. Up to one-third of people affected have aura: typically a short period of visual disturbance that signals that the headache will soon occur. Occasionally, aura can occur with little or no headache following, but not everyone has this symptom.\\n\\nMigraine is believed to be due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors. About two-thirds of cases run in families. Changing hormone levels may also play a role, as migraine affects slightly more boys than girls before puberty and two to three times more women than men. The risk of migraine usually decreases during pregnancy and after menopause. The underlying mechanisms are not fully known. They are, however, believed to involve the nerves and blood vessels of the brain.\\n\\nInitial recommended treatment is with simple pain medication such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) for the headache, medication for the nausea, and the avoidance of triggers. Specific medications such as triptans or ergotamines may be used in those for whom simple pain medications are not effective. Caffeine in combination with other analgesics is safe and effective in treatment of acute migraine. A number of medications are useful to prevent attacks including metoprolol, valproate, and topiramate.\\n\\nGlobally, approximately 15% of people are affected by migraine. In the Global Burden of Disease Study of 2010, it was ranked as the third most prevalent disorder in the world. It most often starts at puberty and is worst during middle age. As of 2016, it is one of the most common causes of disability. An early description consistent with migraines is contained in the Ebers papyrus, written around 1500\\xa0BC in ancient Egypt. The word \\'\\'migraine\\'\\' is from the Greek ἡμικρᾱνίᾱ (\\'\\'hēmikrāníā\\'\\'), \\'pain in half of the head\\', from ἡμι- (\\'\\'hēmi-\\'\\'), \\'half\\', and κρᾱνίον (\\'\\'krāníon\\'\\'), \\'skull\\'.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\nMigraine typically presents with self-limited, recurrent severe headache associated with autonomic symptoms. About 15–30% of people living with migraine experience episodes with aura, and they also frequently experience episodes without aura. The severity of the pain, duration of the headache, and frequency of attacks are variable. A migraine lasting longer than 72 hours is termed status migrainosus. There are four possible phases to a migraine, although not all the phases are necessarily experienced:\\n The prodrome, which occurs hours or days before the headache\\n The aura, which immediately precedes the headache\\n The pain phase, also known as headache phase\\n The postdrome, the effects experienced following the end of a migraine attack\\n\\nMigraine is associated with major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder. These psychiatric disorders are approximately 2–5 times more common in people without aura, and 3–10 times more common in people with aura.\\n\\nProdrome phase\\nProdromal or premonitory symptoms occur in about 60% of those with migraines, with an onset that can range from two hours to two days before the start of pain or the aura. These symptoms may include a wide variety of phenomena, including altered mood, irritability, depression or euphoria, fatigue, craving for certain food(s), stiff muscles (especially in the neck), constipation or diarrhea, and sensitivity to smells or noise. This may occur in those with either migraine with aura or migraine without aura. Neuroimaging indicates the limbic system and hypothalamus as the origin of prodromal symptoms in migraine.\\n\\nAura phase\\n150px|Enhancements reminiscent of a zigzag fort structure150px|Negative scotoma, loss of awareness of local structures150px|Positive scotoma, local perception of additional structures150px|Mostly one-sided loss of perception\\n\\nAura is a transient focal neurological phenomenon that occurs before or during the headache. Aura appears gradually over a number of minutes (usually occurring over 5–60 minutes) and generally lasts less than 60\\xa0minutes. Symptoms can be visual, sensory or motoric in nature, and many people experience more than one. Visual effects occur most frequently: they occur in up to 99% of cases and in more than 50% of cases are not accompanied by sensory or motor effects.\\n\\nVisual disturbances often consist of a scintillating scotoma (an area of partial alteration in the field of vision which flickers and may interfere with a person\\'s ability to read or drive). These typically start near the center of vision and then spread out to the sides with zigzagging lines which have been described as looking like fortifications or walls of a castle. Usually the lines are in black and white but some people also see colored lines. Some people lose part of their field of vision known as hemianopsia while others experience blurring.\\n\\nSensory aura are the second most common type; they occur in 30–40% of people with auras. Often a feeling of pins-and-needles begins on one side in the hand and arm and spreads to the nose–mouth area on the same side. Numbness usually occurs after the tingling has passed with a loss of position sense. Other symptoms of the aura phase can include speech or language disturbances, world spinning, and less commonly motor problems. Motor symptoms indicate that this is a hemiplegic migraine, and weakness often lasts longer than one hour unlike other auras. Auditory hallucinations or delusions have also been described.\\n\\nPain phase\\nClassically the headache is unilateral, throbbing, and moderate to severe in intensity. It usually comes on gradually and is aggravated by physical activity. However, the effects of physical activity on migraine are complex and some researchers have concluded that, while exercise can trigger migraine attacks, regular exercise may have a prophylactic effect and decrease frequency of attacks. The feeling of pulsating pain is not in phase with the pulse. In more than 40% of cases, however, the pain may be bilateral and neck pain is commonly associated with it. Bilateral pain is particularly common in those who have migraine without aura. Less commonly pain may occur primarily in the back or top of the head. The pain usually lasts 4 to 72 hours in adults, however in young children frequently lasts less than 1\\xa0hour. The frequency of attacks is variable, from a few in a lifetime to several a week, with the average being about one a month.\\n\\nThe pain is frequently accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, sensitivity to smells, fatigue and irritability. Many thus seek a dark and quiet room. In a basilar migraine, a migraine with neurological symptoms related to the brain stem or with neurological symptoms on both sides of the body, common effects include a sense of the world spinning, light-headedness, and confusion. Nausea occurs in almost 90% of people, and vomiting occurs in about one-third. Other symptoms may include blurred vision, nasal stuffiness, diarrhea, frequent urination, pallor, or sweating. Swelling or tenderness of the scalp may occur as can neck stiffness. Associated symptoms are less common in the elderly.\\n\\nSilent migraine\\nSometimes, aura occurs without a subsequent headache. This is known in modern classification as a typical aura without headache, or acephalgic migraine in previous classification, or commonly as a silent migraine. However, silent migraine can still produce debilitating symptoms, with visual disturbance, vision loss in half of both eyes, alterations in color perception, and other sensory problems, like sensitivity to light, sound, and odors, and aura sudden outbreak without headache can be scary. It can last from 15 to 30 minutes, usually no longer than 60 minutes, and it can recur or appear as an isolated event.\\n\\nPostdrome\\nThe migraine postdrome could be defined as that constellation of symptoms occurring once the acute headache has settled. Many report a sore feeling in the area where the migraine was, and some report impaired thinking for a few days after the headache has passed. The person may feel tired or \"hung over\" and have head pain, cognitive difficulties, gastrointestinal symptoms, mood changes, and weakness. According to one summary, \"Some people feel unusually refreshed or euphoric after an attack, whereas others note depression and malaise.\" For some individuals this can vary each time.\\n\\nCause\\nThe underlying causes of migraines are unknown. However, they are believed to be related to a mix of environmental and genetic factors. They run in families in about two-thirds of cases and rarely occur due to a single gene defect. While migraines were once believed to be more common in those of high intelligence, this does not appear to be true. A number of psychological conditions are associated, including depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, as are many biological events or triggers.\\n\\nGenetics\\n\\nStudies of twins indicate a 34% to 51% genetic influence of likelihood to develop migraine. This genetic relationship is stronger for migraine with aura than for migraines without aura. A number of specific variants of genes increase the risk by a small to moderate amount.\\n\\nSingle gene disorders that result in migraines are rare. One of these is known as familial hemiplegic migraine, a type of migraine with aura, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Four genes have been shown to be involved in familial hemiplegic migraine. Three of these genes are involved in ion transport. The fourth is an axonal protein associated with the exocytosis complex. Another genetic disorder associated with migraine is CADASIL syndrome or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. One meta-analysis found a protective effect from an angiotensin converting enzyme polymorphisms on migraine. The \\'\\'TRPM8\\'\\' gene, which codes for a cation channel, has been linked to migraines.\\n\\nTriggers\\nMigraine may be induced by triggers, with some reporting it as an influence in a minority of cases and others the majority. Many things such as fatigue, certain foods, and weather have been labeled as triggers; however, the strength and significance of these relationships are uncertain. Most people with migraines report experiencing triggers. Symptoms may start up to 24 hours after a trigger.\\n\\nPhysiological aspects\\nCommon triggers quoted are stress, hunger, and fatigue (these equally contribute to tension headaches). Psychological stress has been reported as a factor by 50 to 80% of people. Migraine has also been associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and abuse. Migraine episodes are more likely to occur around menstruation. Other hormonal influences, such as menarche, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, perimenopause, and menopause, also play a role. These hormonal influences seem to play a greater role in migraine without aura. Migraine episodes typically do not occur during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, or following menopause.\\n\\nDietary aspects\\nBetween 12 and 60% of people report foods as triggers. Evidence for such triggers, however, mostly relies on self-reports and is not rigorous enough to prove or disprove any particular trigger. A clear explanation for why food might trigger migraines is also lacking.\\n\\nThere does not appear to be evidence for an effect of tyramine – which is naturally present in chocolate, alcoholic beverages, most cheeses and processed meats – on migraine. Likewise, while monosodium glutamate (MSG) is frequently reported, evidence does not consistently support that it is a dietary trigger.\\n\\nEnvironmental aspects\\nA review on potential triggers in the indoor and outdoor environment concluded that there is insufficient evidence to confirm environmental factors as causing migraine. They nevertheless suggested that people living with migraine take some preventive measures related to indoor air quality and lighting. This includes ventilation and various black out items to reduce light at the maximum rate.\\n\\nPathophysiology\\nthumb|Animation of cortical spreading depression\\nMigraine is believed to be primarily a neurological disorder, while others believe it to be a neurovascular disorder with blood vessels playing the key role, although current evidence does not support this completely. Others believe both are likely important. One theory is related to increased excitability of the cerebral cortex and abnormal control of pain neurons in the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem.\\n\\nAura\\nCortical spreading depression, or \\'\\'spreading depression\\'\\' according to Leão, is a burst of neuronal activity followed by a period of inactivity, which is seen in those with migraines with aura. There are a number of explanations for its occurrence, including activation of NMDA receptors leading to calcium entering the cell. After the burst of activity, the blood flow to the cerebral cortex in the area affected is decreased for two to six hours. It is believed that when depolarization travels down the underside of the brain, nerves that sense pain in the head and neck are triggered.\\n\\nPain\\nThe exact mechanism of the head pain which occurs during a migraine episode is unknown. Some evidence supports a primary role for central nervous system structures (such as the brainstem and diencephalon), while other data support the role of peripheral activation (such as via the sensory nerves that surround blood vessels of the head and neck). The potential candidate vessels include dural arteries, pial arteries and extracranial arteries such as those of the scalp. The role of vasodilatation of the extracranial arteries, in particular, is believed to be significant.\\n\\nNeuromodulators\\nAdenosine, a neuromodulator, may be involved. Released after the progressive cleavage of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine acts on adenosine receptors to put the body and brain in a low activity state by dilating blood vessels and slowing the heart rate, such as before and during the early stages of sleep. Adenosine levels have been found to be high during migraine attacks. Caffeine\\'s role as an inhibitor of adenosine may explain its effect in reducing migraine. Low levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), are also believed to be involved.\\n\\nCalcitonin gene related peptides (CGRPs) have been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of the pain associated with migraine, as levels of it become elevated during an attack.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of a migraine is based on signs and symptoms. Neuroimaging tests are not necessary to diagnose migraine, but may be used to find other causes of headaches in those whose examination and history do not confirm a migraine diagnosis. It is believed that a substantial number of people with the condition remain undiagnosed.\\n\\nThe diagnosis of migraine without aura, according to the International Headache Society, can be made according to the following criteria, the \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1 criteria\":\\n Five or more attacks—for migraine \\'\\'with\\'\\' aura, two attacks are sufficient for diagnosis.\\n Four hours to three days in duration\\n Two or more of the following:\\n Unilateral (affecting one side of the head)\\n Pulsating\\n Moderate or severe pain intensity\\n Worsened by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity\\n One or more of the following:\\n Nausea and/or vomiting;\\n Sensitivity to both light (photophobia) and sound (phonophobia)\\n\\nIf someone experiences two of the following: photophobia, nausea, or inability to work or study for a day, the diagnosis is more likely. In those with four out of five of the following: pulsating headache, duration of 4–72 hours, pain on one side of the head, nausea, or symptoms that interfere with the person\\'s life, the probability that this is a migraine is 92%. In those with fewer than three of these symptoms the probability is 17%.\\n\\nClassification\\n\\nMigraine was first comprehensively classified in 1988. The International Headache Society updated their classification of headaches in 2004. A third version was published in 2018. According to this classification, migraine is a primary headache disorder along with tension-type headaches and cluster headaches, among others.\\n\\nMigraine is divided into seven subclasses (some of which include further subdivisions):\\n \\'\\'Migraine without aura\\'\\', or \"common migraine\", involves migraine headaches that are not accompanied by aura.\\n \\'\\'Migraine with aura\\'\\', or \"classic migraine\", usually involves migraine headaches accompanied by aura. Less commonly, aura can occur without a headache, or with a nonmigraine headache. Two other varieties are familial hemiplegic migraine and sporadic hemiplegic migraine, in which a person has migraine with aura and with accompanying motor weakness. If a close relative has had the same condition, it is called \"familial\", otherwise it is called \"sporadic\". Another variety is basilar-type migraine, where a headache and aura are accompanied by difficulty speaking, world spinning, ringing in ears, or a number of other brainstem-related symptoms, but not motor weakness. This type was initially believed to be due to spasms of the basilar artery, the artery that supplies the brainstem. Now that this mechanism is not believed to be primary, the symptomatic term migraine with brainstem aura (MBA) is preferred.\\n Childhood periodic syndromes that are commonly precursors of migraine include cyclical vomiting (occasional intense periods of vomiting), abdominal migraine (abdominal pain, usually accompanied by nausea), and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (occasional attacks of vertigo).\\n Retinal migraine involves migraine headaches accompanied by visual disturbances or even temporary blindness in one eye.\\n \\'\\'Complications of migraine\\'\\' describe migraine headaches and/or auras that are unusually long or unusually frequent, or associated with a seizure or brain lesion.\\n \\'\\'Probable migraine\\'\\' describes conditions that have some characteristics of migraines, but where there is not enough evidence to diagnose it as a migraine with certainty (in the presence of concurrent medication overuse).\\n \\'\\'Chronic migraine\\'\\' is a complication of migraines, and is a headache that fulfills diagnostic criteria for \\'\\'migraine headache\\'\\' and occurs for a greater time interval.  Specifically, greater or equal to 15 days/month for longer than 3 months.\\n\\nAbdominal migraine\\nThe diagnosis of abdominal migraine is controversial. Some evidence indicates that recurrent episodes of abdominal pain in the absence of a headache may be a type of migraine or are at least a precursor to migraines. These episodes of pain may or may not follow a migraine-like prodrome and typically last minutes to hours. They often occur in those with either a personal or family history of typical migraine. Other syndromes that are believed to be precursors include cyclical vomiting syndrome and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood.\\n\\nDifferential diagnosis\\nOther conditions that can cause similar symptoms to a migraine headache include temporal arteritis, cluster headaches, acute glaucoma, meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Temporal arteritis typically occurs in people over 50 years old and presents with tenderness over the temple, cluster headache presents with one-sided nose stuffiness, tears and severe pain around the orbits, acute glaucoma is associated with vision problems, meningitis with fevers, and subarachnoid hemorrhage with a very fast onset. Tension headaches typically occur on both sides, are not pounding, and are less disabling.\\n\\nThose with stable headaches that meet criteria for migraines should not receive neuroimaging to look for other intracranial disease. This requires that other concerning findings such as papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) are not present. People with migraines are not at an increased risk of having another cause for severe headaches.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nPreventive treatments of migraine include medications, nutritional supplements, lifestyle alterations, and surgery. Prevention is recommended in those who have headaches more than two days a week, cannot tolerate the medications used to treat acute attacks, or those with severe attacks that are not easily controlled. Recommended lifestyle changes include stopping tobacco use and reducing behaviors that interfere with sleep.\\n\\nThe goal is to reduce the frequency, painfulness, and duration of migraine episodes, and to increase the effectiveness of abortive therapy. Another reason for prevention is to avoid medication overuse headache. This is a common problem and can result in chronic daily headache.\\n\\nMedication\\nPreventive migraine medications are considered effective if they reduce the frequency or severity of the migraine attacks by at least 50%. Due to few medications being approved specifically for the preventative treatment of migraine headaches; many medications such as beta-blockers, anticonvulsive agents such as topiramate or sodium valproate, antidepressants such as amitriptyline and calcium channel blockers such as flunarizine are used off label for the preventative treatment of migraine headaches. Guidelines are fairly consistent in rating the anticonvulsants topiramate and divalproex/sodium valproate, and the beta blockers propranolol and metoprolol as having the highest level of evidence for first-line use for migraine prophylaxis in adults. Propranolol and topiramate have the best evidence in children; however, evidence only supports short term benefit as of 2020.\\n\\nThe beta blocker Timolol is also effective for migraine prevention and in reducing migraine attack frequency and severity. While beta blockers are often used for first-line treatment, other antihypertensives also have a proven efficiency in migraine prevention, namely the calcium channel blocker Verapamil and the angiotensin receptor blocker Candesartan.\\n\\nTentative evidence also supports the use of magnesium supplementation. Increasing dietary intake may be better. Recommendations regarding effectiveness varied for the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin. Frovatriptan is effective for prevention of menstrual migraine.\\n\\nThe antidepressants Amitriptyline and venlafaxine are probably also effective. Angiotensin inhibition by either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist may reduce attacks.\\n\\nMedications in the anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide, including eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab, appear to decrease the frequency of migraines by one to two per month. They are, however, expensive: a year of erenumab costs $6,900 as of 2019.\\n\\nAlternative therapies\\nAcupuncture has a small effect in reducing migraine frequency, compared to sham acupuncture, a practice where needles are placed randomly or do not penetrate the skin. Physiotherapy, massage and relaxation, and chiropractic manipulation might be as effective as propranolol or topiramate in the prevention of migraine headaches; however, the research had some problems with methodology. Another review, however, found evidence to support spinal manipulation to be poor and insufficient to support its use.\\n\\nTentative evidence supports the use of stress reduction techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and relaxation techniques. Regular physical exercise may decrease the frequency. Numerous psychological approaches have been developed that are aimed at preventing or reducing the frequency of migraine in adults including educational approaches, relaxation techniques, assistance in developing coping strategies, strategies to change the way one thinks of a migraine, and strategies to reduce the symptoms of a migraine. The medical evidence supporting the effectiveness of these types of psychological approaches is very limited.\\n\\nAmong alternative medicines, butterbur has the best evidence for its use. However, unprocessed butterbur contains chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) which can cause liver damage, however there are versions that are PA free. In addition, butterbur may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to plants such as ragweed. There is tentative evidence that coenzyme Q10 reduces migraine frequency.\\n\\nFeverfew has traditionally been used as a treatment for fever, headache and migraine, women’s conditions such as difficulties in labour and regulation of menstruation, relief of stomach ache, toothache and insect bites. During the last decades, it has mainly been used for headache and as a preventive treatment for migraine. The plant parts used for medicinal use are the dried leaves or the dried aerial parts. Several historical data supports feverfew’s traditional medicinal uses. In addition, several clinical studies have been performed assessing the efficacy and safety of feverfew monotherapy in the prevention of migraine. The majority of the clinical trials favoured feverfew over placebo. The data also suggest that feverfew is associated with only mild and transient adverse effects. The frequency of migraine was positively affected after treatment with feverfew. Reduction of migraine severity was also reported after intake of feverfew and incidence of nausea and vomiting decreased significantly. No effect of feverfew was reported in one study.\\n\\nThere is tentative evidence for melatonin as an add-on therapy for prevention and treatment of migraine. The data on melatonin are mixed and certain studies have had negative results. The reasons for the mixed findings are unclear but may stem from differences in study design and dosage. Melatonin\\'s possible mechanisms of action in migraine are not completely clear, but may include improved sleep, direct action on melatonin receptors in the brain, and anti-inflammatory properties.\\n\\nDevices and surgery\\nMedical devices, such as biofeedback and neurostimulators, have some advantages in migraine prevention, mainly when common anti-migraine medications are contraindicated or in case of medication overuse. Biofeedback helps people be conscious of some physiological parameters so as to control them and try to relax and may be efficient for migraine treatment. Neurostimulation uses noninvasive or implantable neurostimulators similar to pacemakers for the treatment of intractable chronic migraine with encouraging results for severe cases. A transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator and a transcranial magnetic stimulator are approved in the United States for the prevention of migraines. There is also tentative evidence for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation decreases the frequency of migraines. Migraine surgery, which involves decompression of certain nerves around the head and neck, may be an option in certain people who do not improve with medications.\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nThere are three main aspects of treatment: trigger avoidance, acute symptomatic control, and medication for prevention. Medications are more effective if used earlier in an attack. The frequent use of medications may result in medication overuse headache, in which the headaches become more severe and more frequent. This may occur with triptans, ergotamines, and analgesics, especially opioid analgesics. Due to these concerns simple analgesics are recommended to be used less than three days per week at most.\\n\\nAnalgesics\\nRecommended initial treatment for those with mild to moderate symptoms are simple analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or the combination of paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen), aspirin, and caffeine. Several NSAIDs, including diclofenac and ibuprofen have evidence to support their use. Aspirin can relieve moderate to severe migraine pain, with an effectiveness similar to sumatriptan. Ketorolac is available in intravenous and intramuscular formulations.\\n\\nParacetamol, either alone or in combination with metoclopramide, is another effective treatment with a low risk of adverse effects. Intravenous metoclopramide is also effective by itself. In pregnancy, paracetamol and metoclopramide are deemed safe as are NSAIDs until the third trimester.\\n\\nNaproxen by itself may not be effective as a stand-alone medicine to stop a migraine headache as it is only weakly better than a placebo medication in clinical trials.\\n\\n Antiemetics \\n\\nTriptans\\nTriptans such as sumatriptan are medications used to stop an active migraine headache (an abortive medication). Triptans are the initially recommended treatments for those with moderate to severe pain from an acute migraine headache or those with milder symptoms who do not respond to simple analgesics. Triptans have been shown to be effective for both pain and nausea in up to 75% of people.  There are different methods or routes of administration to take sumatriptan including oral (by mouth), injectable (subcutaneous), rectal, nasal spray, and oral dissolving tablets. For people with migraine symptoms such as nausea or vomitting, taking the abortive medicine by mouth or through the nose may be difficult. All route of administration have been shown to be effective at reducing migraine symptoms, however, nasal and injectable subcutaneous administration may result in more side effects. The adverse effects associated with rectal administration have not been well studied. Some people may find that they respond to one type of sumatripton better than another.\\n\\nMost side effects are mild, including flushing; however, rare cases of myocardial ischemia have occurred. They are thus not recommended for people with cardiovascular disease, who have had a stroke, or have migraines that are accompanied by neurological problems. In addition, triptans should be prescribed with caution for those with risk factors for vascular disease. While historically not recommended in those with basilar migraines there is no specific evidence of harm from their use in this population to support this caution. Triptans are not addictive, but may cause medication-overuse headaches if used more than 10 days per month.\\n\\nSumatriptan does not prevent other migraine headaches from starting in the future. For increased effectiveness at stopping migraine symptoms, a combined therapy that includes sumatriptan and naproxen may be suggested.\\n\\nCGRP receptor antagonists\\nCGRP receptor antagonists target calcitonin gene-related peptide or its receptor to prevent migraine headaches or reduce their severity. CGRP is a signaling molecule as well as a potent vasodilator that is involved in the development of a migraine headache. There are four injectable monoclonal antibodies that target CGRP or it\\'s receptor (eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab) and the medications have demonstrated efficacy in the preventative treatment of episodic and chronic migraine headaches in phase 3 randomized clinical trials. Eptinezumab is available as an infusion every three months, Erenumab and galcanezumab are once monthly injections and fremanezumab is a monthly or quarterly injection.\\n\\nErgotamines\\nErgotamine and dihydroergotamine are older medications still prescribed for migraines, the latter in nasal spray and injectable forms. They appear equally effective to the triptans and experience adverse effects that typically are benign. In the most severe cases, such as those with status migrainosus, they appear to be the most effective treatment option. They can cause vasospasm including coronary vasospasm and are contraindicated in people with coronary artery disease.\\n\\n Magnesium \\nMagnesium is recognized as an inexpensive, over-the-counter supplement which some studies have shown to be effective in both preventing and treating migraine in intravenous form.\\n\\nOther\\nIntravenous metoclopramide, intravenous prochlorperazine, or intranasal lidocaine are other potential options. Metoclopramide or prochlorperazine are the recommended treatment for those who present to the emergency department. Haloperidol may also be useful in this group. A single dose of intravenous dexamethasone, when added to standard treatment of a migraine attack, is associated with a 26% decrease in headache recurrence in the following 72 hours. Spinal manipulation for treating an ongoing migraine headache is not supported by evidence. It is recommended that opioids and barbiturates not be used due to questionable efficacy, addictive potential, and the risk of rebound headache. There is tentative evidence that propofol may be useful if other measures are not effective.\\n\\nOccipital nerve stimulation, may be effective but has the downsides of being cost-expensive and has a significant amount of complications.\\n\\nThere is modest evidence for the effectiveness of non-invasive neuromodulatory devices, behavioral therapies and acupuncture in the treatment of migraine headaches. There is little to no evidence for the effectiveness of physical therapy, chiropractic manipulation and dietary approaches to the treatment of migraine headaches. Behavioral treatment of migraine headaches may be helpful for those who may not be able to take medications (for example pregnant women).\\n\\nFeverfew is registered as a traditional herbal medicine in the Nordic countries under the brand name Glitinum, only powdered feverfew is approved in the Herbal community monograph issued by European Medicines Agency (EMA).\\n\\nSexual activity, particularly orgasm, may provide relief for some migraineurs.\\n\\nChildren\\nIbuprofen helps decrease pain in children with migraines and is the initially recommended treatment. Paracetamol does not appear to be effective in providing pain relief. Triptans are effective, though there is a risk of causing minor side effects like taste disturbance, nasal symptoms, dizziness, fatigue, low energy, nausea, or vomiting. Ibuprofen should be used less than half the days in a month and triptans less than a third of the days in a month to decrease the risk of medication overuse headache.\\n\\nChronic migraine\\nTopiramate and botulinum toxin (Botox) have evidence in treating chronic migraine. Botulinum toxin has been found to be useful in those with chronic migraine but not those with episodic ones. The anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody erenumab was found in one study to decrease chronic migraines by 2.4 days more than placebo.\\n\\nPrognosis\\n\"Migraine exists on a continuum of different attack frequencies and associated levels of disability.\" For those with occasional, episodic migraine, a \"proper combination of drugs for prevention and treatment of migraine attacks\" can limit the disease\\'s impact on patients\\' personal and professional lives.  But fewer than half of people with migraine seek medical care and more than half go undiagnosed and undertreated. \"Responsive prevention and treatment of migraine is incredibly important\" because evidence shows \"an increased sensitivity after each successive attack, eventually leading to chronic daily migraine in some individuals.\" Repeated migraine results in \"reorganization of brain circuitry,\" causing \"profound functional as well as structural changes in the brain.\" \"One of the most important problems in clinical migraine is the progression from an intermittent, self-limited inconvenience to a life-changing disorder of chronic pain, sensory amplification, and autonomic and affective disruption. This progression, sometimes termed chronification in the migraine literature, is common, affecting 3% of migraineurs in a given year, such that 8% of migraineurs have chronic migraine in any given year.\" Brain imagery reveals that the electrophysiological changes seen during an attack become permanent in people with chronic migraine; \"thus, from an electrophysiological point of view, chronic migraine indeed resembles a never-ending migraine attack.\" Severe migraine ranks in the highest category of disability, according to the World Health Organization, which uses objective metrics to determine disability burden for the authoritative annual \\'\\'Global Burden of Disease\\'\\' report. The report classifies severe migraine alongside severe depression, active psychosis, quadriplegia, and terminal-stage cancer.\\n\\nMigraine with aura appears to be a risk factor for ischemic stroke doubling the risk. Being a young adult, being female, using hormonal birth control, and smoking further increases this risk. There also appears to be an association with cervical artery dissection. Migraine without aura does not appear to be a factor. The relationship with heart problems is inconclusive with a single study supporting an association. Migraine does not appear to increase the risk of death from stroke or heart disease. Preventative therapy of migraines in those with migraine with aura may prevent associated strokes. People with migraine, particularly women, may develop higher than average numbers of white matter brain lesions of unclear significance.\\n\\nEpidemiology\\nthumb|Disability-adjusted life year for migraines per 100,000\\xa0inhabitants in 2004\\n\\nWorldwide, migraine affects nearly 15% or approximately one billion people. It is more common in women at 19% than men at 11%. In the United States, about 6% of men and 18% of women experience a migraine attack in a given year, with a lifetime risk of about 18% and 43% respectively. In Europe, migraines affect 12–28% of people at some point in their lives with about 6–15% of adult men and 14–35% of adult women getting at least one yearly. Rates of migraine are slightly lower in Asia and Africa than in Western countries. Chronic migraine occurs in approximately 1.4 to 2.2% of the population.\\n\\nThese figures vary substantially with age: onset of migraine is most commonly between 15 and 24 years of age, and occur most frequently in those 35 to 45 years of age. In children, about 1.7% of 7\\xa0year olds and 3.9% of those between 7 and 15 experience migraine, with the condition being slightly more common in boys before puberty. Children as young as two years may be affected. During adolescence, migraine becomes more common among women and this persists for the rest of the lifespan, being twice as common among elderly females than males. In women migraine without aura are more common than migraine with aura; however in men the two types occur with similar frequency.\\n \\nDuring perimenopause symptoms often get worse before decreasing in severity. While symptoms resolve in about two thirds of the elderly, in 3 to 10% they persist.\\n\\nHistory\\nthumb|\\'\\'The Head Ache\\'\\', George Cruikshank (1819)\\nAn early description consistent with migraine is contained in the Ebers papyrus, written around 1500\\xa0BCE in ancient Egypt. In 200 BCE, writings from the Hippocratic school of medicine described the visual aura that can precede the headache and a partial relief occurring through vomiting.\\n\\nA second-century description by Aretaeus of Cappadocia divided headaches into three types: cephalalgia, cephalea, and heterocrania. Galen of Pergamon used the term hemicrania (half-head), from which the word migraine was eventually derived. He also proposed that the pain arose from the meninges and blood vessels of the head. Migraine was first divided into the two now used types – migraine with aura (\\'\\'migraine ophthalmique\\'\\') and migraine without aura (\\'\\'migraine vulgaire\\'\\') in 1887 by Louis Hyacinthe Thomas, a French Librarian. The mystical visions of Hildegard von Bingen, which she described as “reflections of the living light\", are consistent with the visual aura experienced during migraines.\\n\\nthumb|left|A trepanated skull, from the Neolithic. The perimeter of the hole in the skull is rounded off by ingrowth of new bony tissue, indicating that the person survived the operation. \\nTrepanation, the deliberate drilling of holes into a skull, was practiced as early as 7,000\\xa0BCE. While sometimes people survived, many would have died from the procedure due to infection. It was believed to work via \"letting evil spirits escape\". William Harvey recommended trepanation as a treatment for migraines in the 17th century.\\n\\nWhile many treatments for migraine have been attempted, it was not until 1868 that use of a substance which eventually turned out to be effective began. This substance was the fungus ergot from which ergotamine was isolated in 1918. Methysergide was developed in 1959 and the first triptan, sumatriptan, was developed in 1988. During the 20th century with better study-design, effective preventive measures were found and confirmed.\\n\\nSociety and culture\\nMigraine is a significant source of both medical costs and lost productivity. It has been estimated that migraine is the most costly neurological disorder in the European Community, costing more than €27\\xa0billion per year. In the United States, direct costs have been estimated at $17\\xa0billion, while indirect costs — such as missed or decreased ability to work — is estimated at $15\\xa0billion. Nearly a tenth of the direct cost is due to the cost of triptans. In those who do attend work with a migraine, effectiveness is decreased by around a third. Negative impacts also frequently occur for a person\\'s family.\\n\\nResearch\\n\\n Potential prevention mechanisms \\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation shows promise as does transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation. There is preliminary evidence that a ketogenic diet may help prevent episodic and long-term migraine.\\n\\n Potential gender dependency \\nWhile no definitive proof has been found linking migraine to gender, statistical data indicates that women may be more prone to suffer from migraine, showing migraine incidence three times higher among women than men. The Society for Women’s Health Research has also mentioned hormonal influences, mainly estrogen, as having a considerable role in provoking migraine pain. Studies and research related to the gender dependencies of migraine are still ongoing, and conclusions have yet to be achieved. \\n\\n See also \\nMigraine Aura Foundation\\n\\n References \\n\\nNotes\\n \\n\\n Further reading \\n \\n\\n External links \\n\\n \\n2019 Guideline on migraine prevention in children\\n2019 Guideline on migraine treatment in children\\n\\n \\nCategory:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate (full)\\nCategory:Wikipedia neurology articles ready to translate'), Row(id=23862, text='\\'\\'\\'Python\\'\\'\\' is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python\\'s design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.\\n\\nPython is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.\\n\\nGuido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python\\xa02.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python\\xa03.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python\\xa02 code does not run unmodified on Python\\xa03. Python\\xa02 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.\\n\\nPython consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.\\n\\nHistory\\nthumb|150px|The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at OSCON 2006\\n\\nPython was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to  ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python\\'s \\'\\'Benevolent Dictator For Life\\'\\', a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project\\'s chief decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a 5-member \"Steering Council\" to lead the project. As of 2021, the current members of this council are Barry Warsaw, Brett Cannon, Carol Willing, Thomas Wouters, and Pablo Galindo Salgado.\\n\\nPython\\xa02.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.\\n\\nPython\\xa03.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Many of its major features were backported to Python\\xa02.6.x and 2.7.x version series.  Releases of Python\\xa03 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python\\xa02 code to Python\\xa03.\\n\\nPython\\xa02.7\\'s end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python\\xa03.  No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python\\xa02\\'s end-of-life, only  Python\\xa03.6.x and later are supported.\\n\\nPython\\xa03.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited as all versions of Python (including 2.7) had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning.\\n\\nDesign philosophy and features\\nPython is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming and metaobjects (magic methods)). Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.\\n\\nPython uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\\n\\nPython\\'s design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has  functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.\\n\\nThe language\\'s core philosophy is summarized in the document \\'\\'The Zen of Python\\'\\' (\\'\\'PEP 20\\'\\'), which includes aphorisms such as:\\n\\n Beautiful is better than ugly.\\n Explicit is better than implicit.\\n Simple is better than complex.\\n Complex is better than complicated.\\n Readability counts.\\n\\nRather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible (with modules). This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum\\'s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.\\n\\nPython strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl\\'s \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, Python embraces a \"there should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it\"  design philosophy. Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that \"To describe something as \\'clever\\' is \\'\\'not\\'\\' considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"\\n\\nPython\\'s developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.\\n\\nAn important goal of Python\\'s developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language\\'s name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from a famous Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.\\n\\nA common neologism in the Python community is \\'\\'pythonic\\'\\', which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python\\'s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called \\'\\'unpythonic\\'\\'.\\n\\nUsers and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as \\'\\'Pythonistas\\'\\'.\\n\\nSyntax and semantics\\n\\nPython is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but are rarely, if ever, used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.\\n\\nIndentation\\n\\nPython uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program\\'s visual structure accurately represents the program\\'s semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation doesn\\'t have any semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.\\n\\nStatements and control flow\\nPython\\'s statements include (among others):\\n The assignment statement, using a single equals sign =.\\n The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if).\\n The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.\\n The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.\\n The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.\\n The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception.\\n The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming.\\n The def statement, which defines a function or method.\\n The with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.\\n The break statement, exits from a loop.\\n The continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item.\\n The del statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will cause an error. A deleted variable can be reassigned.\\n The pass statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.\\n The assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply.\\n The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines.\\n The return statement, used to return a value from a function.\\n The import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program.\\n\\nThe assignment statement (=) operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically-allocated object. Variables may be subsequently rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder and doesn\\'t have a fixed data type associated with it. However at a given time, a variable will refer to \\'\\'some\\'\\' object, which will have a type. This is referred to as dynamic typing and is contrasted with statically-typed programming languages, where each variable may only contain values of a certain type.\\n\\nPython does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided, by extending Python\\'s generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python\\xa02.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python\\xa03.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.\\n\\nExpressions\\nSome Python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as C and Java, while some are not:\\n Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division (or integer division) // and floating-point/division. Python also uses the ** operator for exponentiation.\\n From Python\\xa03.5, the new @ infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.\\n From Python\\xa03.8, the syntax :=, called the \\'walrus operator\\' was introduced. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.\\n In Python, == compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value and objects by reference. (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the equals() method.) Python\\'s is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example .\\n Python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &&, ||, ! used in Java and C.\\n Python has a type of expression termed a \\'\\'list comprehension\\'\\' as well as a more general expression termed a \\'\\'generator expression\\'\\'.\\n Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.\\n Conditional expressions in Python are written as  (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages).\\n Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as , are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples are written as , are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to , executing  first evaluates , which yields , which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.\\n Python features \\'\\'sequence unpacking\\'\\' wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an \\'\\'iterable\\'\\' object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.\\n Python has a \"string format\" operator %. This functions analogously to printf format strings in C, e.g.  evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". In Python\\xa03 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. . Python\\xa03.6 added \"f-strings\": .\\n Strings in Python can be concatenated, by \"adding\" them (same operator as for adding integers and floats). E.g.  returns \"spameggs\". Even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. E.g.  returns \"22\".\\n Python has various kinds of string literals:\\n Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash (\\\\) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python\\xa03.6 as \"formatted string literals\".\\n Triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl and Ruby.\\n Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows-style paths. Compare \"@-quoting\" in C#.\\n Python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a[key],  or . Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the \\'\\'start\\'\\' index up to, but not including, the \\'\\'stop\\'\\' index. The third slice parameter, called \\'\\'step\\'\\' or \\'\\'stride\\'\\', allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example  returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.\\n\\nIn Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:\\n List comprehensions vs. for-loops\\n Conditional expressions vs. if blocks\\n The eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python\\xa02, exec is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements.\\n\\nStatements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as  cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions:  is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code but  causes a syntax error in Python.\\n\\nMethods\\nMethods on objects are functions attached to the object\\'s class; the syntax  is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for . Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, or Ruby).\\nApart from this Python also provides methods, sometimes called \\'\\'dunder methods\\'\\' due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores, to extend the functionality of custom class to support native functions such as print, length, comparison, support for arithmetic operations, type conversion, and many more.\\n\\nTyping\\nthumb|The standard type hierarchy in Python 3\\nPython uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically-typed, Python is strongly-typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.\\n\\nPython allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example,  or ), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\\n\\nBefore version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes: \\'\\'old-style\\'\\' and \\'\\'new-style\\'\\'. The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type). In versions of Python\\xa02 from Python\\xa02.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python\\xa03.0.\\n\\nThe long-term plan is to support gradual typing and from Python\\xa03.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker named \\'\\'mypy\\'\\' supports compile-time type checking.\\n\\n+Summary of Python 3\\'s built-in types Type Mutability Description Syntax examples bool immutable Boolean value  bytearray mutable Sequence of bytes  bytes immutable Sequence of bytes  complex immutable Complex number with real and imaginary parts  dict mutable Associative array (or dictionary) of key and value pairs; can contain mixed types (keys and values), keys must be a hashable type  ellipsis immutable An ellipsis placeholder to be used as an index in NumPy arrays  float immutable Double-precision floating-point number. The precision is machine-dependent but in practice is generally implemented as a 64-bit IEEE 754 number with 53 bits of precision. frozenset immutable Unordered set, contains no duplicates; can contain mixed types, if hashable  int immutable Integer of unlimited magnitude  list mutable List, can contain mixed types  NoneType immutable An object representing the absence of a value, often called null in other languages  NotImplementedType immutable A placeholder that can be returned from overloaded operators to indicate unsupported operand types.  range immutable A Sequence of numbers commonly used for looping specific number of times in for loops  set mutable Unordered set, contains no duplicates; can contain mixed types, if hashable  str immutable A character string: sequence of Unicode codepoints \"\"\"Spanning\\nmultiple\\nlines\"\"\" tuple immutable Can contain mixed types \\n\\nArithmetic operations\\nPython has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor division operator // and the modulo operation % (where the remainder can be negative,  e.g. 4 % -3 == -2). It also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, and a matrix multiply operator @ . These operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix (+ and - can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively).\\n\\nThe division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:\\n Current Python (i.e. since 3.0) changed / to always be floating-point division, e.g. .\\n Python 2.2 changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. 7/3 == 2 and -7/3 == -3. The floor division // operator was introduced. So 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0 and -7.5//3 == -3.0. Adding  causes a module to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next).\\n Python 2.1 and earlier used C\\'s division behavior. The / operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards 0, e.g.  and .\\n\\nIn Python terms, / is \\'\\'true division\\'\\' (or simply \\'\\'division\\'\\'), and // is \\'\\'floor division.\\'\\' / before version 3.0 is \\'\\'classic division\\'\\'.\\n\\nRounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation  is always true. It also means that the equation  is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, \\'\\'b\\'\\'), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (\\'\\'b\\'\\', 0] when b is negative.\\n\\nPython provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python\\xa03 uses round to even: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2. Versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is −1.0.\\n\\nPython allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.\\n\\nPython uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes. The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.\\n\\nDue to Python\\'s extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library NumPy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.\\n\\nProgramming examples\\nHello world program:\\nprint(\\'Hello, world!\\')\\n\\nProgram to calculate the factorial of a positive integer:\\nn = int(input(\\'Type a number, and its factorial will be printed: \\'))\\n\\nif n < 0:\\n    raise ValueError(\\'You must enter a non negative integer\\')\\n\\nfactorial = 1\\nfor i in range(2, n + 1):\\n    factorial *= i\\n\\nprint(factorial)\\n\\nLibraries\\nPython\\'s large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.\\n\\nSome parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.\\n\\n the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 290,000 packages with a wide range of functionality, including:\\n\\nDevelopment environments\\n\\nMost Python implementations (including CPython) include a read–eval–print loop (REPL), permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately.\\n\\nOther shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting.\\n\\nAs well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are Web browser-based IDEs; SageMath (intended for developing science and math-related Python programs); PythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computing.\\n\\nImplementations\\n\\nReference implementation\\nCPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in C, meeting the C89 standard with several select C99 features (with later C versions out, it\\'s considered outdated;  CPython includes its own C extensions, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions, can e.g. be implemented with C11 or C++). It compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python. It is available for many platforms, including Windows (starting with Python\\xa03.9, the Python installer deliberately fails to install on Windows 7 and 8; Windows XP was supported until Python\\xa03.5) and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python\\xa03.9.1, with experimental installer) and unofficial support for e.g. VMS. Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities, during the Python\\xa01 and 2 time-frame, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported; support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms.\\n\\nOther implementations\\n PyPy is a fast, compliant interpreter of Python\\xa02.7 and 3.6. Its just-in-time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over CPython but several libraries written in C cannot be used with it.\\n Stackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads; it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also has a stackless version.\\n MicroPython and CircuitPython are Python\\xa03 variants optimized for microcontrollers, including Lego Mindstorms EV3.\\n Pyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up the execution of Python programs.\\n Cinder is a performance-oriented fork of CPython 3.8 that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time JIT and an experimental bytecode compiler.\\n\\nUnsupported implementations\\nOther just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:\\n Google began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009, with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter fivefold by using the LLVM, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores, while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock.\\n Psyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python\\xa02.7 or later.\\n PyS60 was a Python\\xa02 interpreter for Series 60 mobile phones released by Nokia in 2005. It implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the Symbian operating system. The Nokia N900 also supports Python with GTK widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device.\\n\\nCross-compilers to other languages\\nThere are several compilers to high-level object languages, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language:\\n Cython compiles (a superset of) Python\\xa02.7 to C (while the resulting code is also usable with Python\\xa03 and also e.g. C++).\\n Nuitka compiles Python into C++.\\n Pythran compiles a subset of Python\\xa03 to C++.\\n Pyrex (latest release in 2010) and Shed Skin (latest release in 2013) compile to C and C++ respectively.\\n Google\\'s Grumpy (latest release in 2017) transpiles Python\\xa02 to Go.\\n IronPython (now abandoned by Microsoft) allows running Python\\xa02.7 programs on the .NET Common Language Runtime.\\n Jython compiles Python\\xa02.7 to Java bytecode, allowing the use of the Java libraries from a Python program.\\n MyHDL is a Python-based hardware description language (HDL), that converts MyHDL code to Verilog or VHDL code.\\n Numba uses LLVM to compile a subset of Python to machine code.\\n Brython, Transcrypt and Pyjs (latest release in 2012) compile Python to JavaScript.\\n RPython can be compiled to C, and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python.\\n\\nPerformance\\nA performance comparison of various Python implementations on a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload was presented at EuroSciPy \\'13. Python\\'s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.\\n\\nDevelopment\\nPython\\'s development is conducted largely through the \\'\\'Python Enhancement Proposal\\'\\' (PEP) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding style is covered in PEP\\xa08. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.\\n\\nEnhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language\\'s development. Specific issues are discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org. Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.\\n\\nCPython\\'s public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:\\n Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0.\\n Major or \"feature\" releases, occurred about every 18 months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with Python\\xa03.9 are expected to happen once a year. They are largely compatible but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release.\\n Bugfix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.\\n\\nMany alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python\\'s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development.\\n\\nThe major academic conference on Python is PyCon. There are also special Python mentoring programmes, such as Pyladies.\\n\\nPythons\\xa03.10 deprecates wstr (to be removed in Python\\xa03.12; meaning Python extensions need to be modified by then), and also plans to add pattern matching to the language.\\n\\nAPI documentation generators\\nTools that can generate documentation for Python API include pydoc (available as part of standard library), Sphinx, Pdoc and its forks, Doxygen and Graphviz, among others.\\n\\nNaming\\nPython\\'s name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture; for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are \\'\\'spam\\'\\' and \\'\\'eggs\\'\\' instead of the traditional \\'\\'foo\\'\\' and \\'\\'bar\\'\\'. The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines.\\n\\nThe prefix \\'\\'Py-\\'\\' is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame, a binding of SDL to Python (commonly used to create games); PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively; and PyPy, a Python implementation originally written in Python.\\n\\nPopularity\\nSince 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index where, , it is the third most popular language (behind Java, and C). It was selected Programming Language of the Year (for \"the highest rise in ratings in a year\") in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 (the only language to do so four times).\\n\\nAn empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often \"better than Java and not much worse than C or C++\".\\n\\nLarge organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo!, CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Spotify and some smaller entities like ILM and ITA. The social news networking site Reddit was written mostly in Python.\\n\\nUses\\n\\nPython can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g., via  for the Apache web server. With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as a data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.\\n\\nLibraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing, with specialized libraries such as Biopython and Astropy providing domain-specific functionality. SageMath is a computer algebra system with a notebook interface programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus. OpenCV has python bindings with a rich set of features for computer vision and image processing.\\n\\nPython is commonly used in artificial intelligence projects and machine learning projects with the help of libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch and Scikit-learn. As a scripting language with modular architecture, simple syntax and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing.\\n\\nPython has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modeler like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D imaging programs like GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro, and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS. It has also been used in several video games, and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go.\\n\\nMany operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most Linux distributions, AmigaOS 4 (using Python\\xa02.7), FreeBSD (as a package), NetBSD, OpenBSD (as a package) and macOS and can be used from the command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage.\\n\\nPython is used extensively in the information security industry, including in exploit development.\\n\\nMost of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, now developed at Sugar Labs, is written in Python. The Raspberry Pi single-board computer project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language.\\n\\nLibreOffice includes Python, and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.\\n\\nLanguages influenced by Python\\nPython\\'s design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages:\\n Boo uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model.\\n Cobra uses indentation and a similar syntax, and its \\'\\'Acknowledgements\\'\\' document lists Python first among languages that influenced it.\\n CoffeeScript, a programming language that cross-compiles to JavaScript, has Python-inspired syntax.\\n ECMAScript/JavaScript borrowed iterators and generators from Python.\\n GDScript, a scripting language very similar to Python, built-in to the Godot game engine.\\n Go is designed for the \"speed of working in a dynamic language like Python\" and shares the same syntax for slicing arrays.\\n Groovy was motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to Java.\\n Julia was designed to be \"as usable for general programming as Python\".\\n Nim uses indentation and similar syntax.\\n Ruby\\'s creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto, has said: \"I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That\\'s why I decided to design my own language.\"\\n Swift, a programming language developed by Apple, has some Python-inspired syntax.\\n\\nPython\\'s development practices have also been emulated by other languages. For example, the practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for, and issues surrounding, a change to the language (in Python, a PEP) is also used in Tcl, Erlang, and Swift.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n Python syntax and semantics\\n pip (package manager)\\n Differentiable programming\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nSources\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nFurther reading\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nExternal links\\n\\n \\n\\n \\nCategory:Articles with example Python (programming language) code\\nCategory:Class-based programming languages\\nCategory:Computational notebook\\nCategory:Computer science in the Netherlands\\nCategory:Cross-platform free software\\nCategory:Cross-platform software\\nCategory:Dutch inventions\\nCategory:Dynamically typed programming languages\\nCategory:Educational programming languages\\nCategory:High-level programming languages\\nCategory:Information technology in the Netherlands\\nCategory:Multi-paradigm programming languages\\nCategory:Object-oriented programming languages\\nCategory:Programming languages\\nCategory:Programming languages created in 1991\\nCategory:Scripting languages\\nCategory:Text-oriented programming languages')]\n",
